## Lyrics

```
smoke a pound on a single bound
smoke a pound on a single bound
smoke a pound on a single bound ya
smoke a pound on a single bound ya

here again with these pointless lessons
precious caring turned away atone for the things you say you mute
or something i can't tell sometimes 
like the things you keep 
leavin' out!
following fresh on clues 
sneezing out 
so bless you for diss
coz you left it out ya



smoke a pound on a single bound
smoke a pound on a single bound
smoke a pound on a single bound ya
smoke a pound on a single bound ya

pupils round

```
